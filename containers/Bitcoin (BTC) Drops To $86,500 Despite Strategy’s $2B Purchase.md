## Frequently Asked Questions  

### 1. What is a Wave 4 correction in Elliott Wave theory?  
Wave 4 corrections occur after extended bullish impulses (Wave 3). They allow markets to consolidate before resuming the trend in Wave 5. Historically, these corrections are shallower and less volatile than Wave 2.  

### 2. Why is the $85,848 Fibonacci level important?  
The 0.382 retracement at $85,848 aligns with historical support zones from Q1 2024. A bounce here could signal short-term stabilization, while a breakdown increases risk toward $79,522.  

### 3. How does Strategy‚Äôs Bitcoin purchase impact the market?  
Large-scale acquisitions absorb selling pressure and demonstrate institutional confidence. However, short-term price action depends on broader macro trends, such as Fed policy and risk appetite.  

### 4. What role does RSI play in Bitcoin‚Äôs price movement?  
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) measures overbought/oversold conditions. A daily RSI below 30 suggests extreme bearish exhaustion, often preceding rebounds. However, sustained recoveries require volume and momentum confirmation.  

### 5. Should investors buy the dip during a Wave 4 correction?  
Wave 4s are high-risk, high-reward opportunities. Conservative investors may wait for a confirmed Wave 5 breakout, while aggressive traders target oversold Fibonacci levels with tight stop-losses.

## Technical Indicators and Market Sentiment  

Bitcoin‚Äôs 1-hour chart reveals aggressive bearish momentum, with BTC breaking below a descending channel and cascading toward $85,848. The RSI on this timeframe is extremely oversold, suggesting a short-term relief rally. However, structural confirmation (e.g., bullish divergence) is needed to validate a sustainable bottom.  

### Complex WXYXZ Corrective Pattern  
This pattern consists of multiple nested corrections (W-X-Y-X-Z), often forming during prolonged consolidations. The final leg (Z-wave) typically concludes near key Fibonacci levels, making $85,848 a high-probability reversal zone.
