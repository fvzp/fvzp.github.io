With Bitcoin surpassing $100,000, the broader market's bullish sentiment creates ideal conditions for crypto-related IPOs. Traditional investors are increasingly viewing blockchain companies as legitimate investment vehicles, with MicroStrategy's Bitcoin strategy serving as a blueprint for corporate digital asset adoption.

### 3. Strategic Business Imperatives

Companies are leveraging IPOs not just for fundraising, but for:
- Enhancing brand credibility
- Securing regulatory compliance
- Facilitating global expansion
- Providing exit opportunities for early investors
