## Macro Market Analysis

### US Equity Market Impact  
While the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 experienced corrections this week, critical technical levels remain intact:  
- **Nasdaq 100 Daily Chart**: Support at MA55 (55-day moving average) holds, suggesting temporary consolidation rather than trend reversal.  
- **BTC Correlation**: Bitcoin's price action remains decoupled from traditional markets, maintaining relative strength despite equity market weakness.  

### Stablecoin Dynamics  
Stablecoin supply reached **$152.35 billion** this week, representing a **$1.28 billion increase** from previous measurements. Key observations:  
| Metric                | Current Value       | Trend Direction |  
|-----------------------|---------------------|-----------------|

| ETF Net Inflows (5D)  | $290 million        | Positive        |

This sustained liquidity injection supports the bullish thesis for crypto markets despite short-term volatility.
