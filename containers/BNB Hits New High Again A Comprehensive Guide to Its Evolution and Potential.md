- **Initial Pricing**: 1 ETH = 2,700 BNB or 1 BTC = 20,000 BNB (‚âà$0.15 per BNB)
- **Rapid Adoption**: Binance exchange launched just 11 days after the ICO
- **Burn Mechanism**: Over 29.4 million BNB destroyed since 2017, reducing circulating supply

## üîç FAQs About BNB

### **Why is BNB rising so rapidly?**
BNB's growth stems from its dual role as both a utility token and governance asset. The BSC ecosystem's explosive DeFi adoption (313% YoY growth) and quarterly token burns create strong supply-demand dynamics.

### **How does BNB's burn mechanism work?**
Binance allocates 20% of quarterly profits to purchase and permanently destroy BNB. This reduces circulating supply while maintaining network security through staking incentives.

### **Can BNB be used outside the Binance ecosystem?**
Yes. BNB powers cross-chain DeFi applications, serves as payment for travel/retail via Binance Card, and secures multiple third-party blockchain networks.

### **What's the future roadmap for BNB?**
Binance plans to expand BNB's role in GameFi, metaverse infrastructure, and cross-chain interoperability solutions. The upcoming Binance Chain 3.0 upgrade aims to enhance scalability and security.
