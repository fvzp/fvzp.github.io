The cryptocurrency exchange platform OKX recently implemented a system rollback to address abnormal trading activities that disrupted market stability. This article details the timeline of events, technical adjustments made to prevent future disruptions, and implications for users. By examining the rollback process and updated trading mechanisms, traders and investors can better understand how exchanges manage systemic risks.

## System Rollback Completion and Trading Resumption (March 30, 2018)

After extensive technical maintenance, OKX successfully completed its system rollback operations by March 30, 2018. The platform restored normal trading functionality at 1:12 AM on March 31, 2018, while also re-enabling withdrawal capabilities. This critical operation followed abnormal trading patterns detected during the early morning hours of March 30, which necessitated immediate corrective action to maintain market integrity.

### Understanding the System Rollback Process

The rollback operation targeted all cryptocurrency contracts, reverting transaction data to the state recorded at 4:47:54 AM HKT on March 30, 2018. This technical intervention specifically addressed irregularities observed during a 15-hour window (5:00-6:30 HKT and subsequent periods), where malicious trading patterns caused significant price distortions.

## New Price Limit Rules Implementation

To prevent recurrence of such market disruptions, OKX implemented enhanced price control mechanisms. These updated rules demonstrate the exchange's commitment to maintaining fair trading environments while protecting user assets.

### Original vs. Revised Price Limit Rules

The following table compares the pre- and post-rollback price control parameters:

| Contract Age | Original Price Limits | New Price Limits |
|--------------|-----------------------|------------------|
| First 10 minutes | Â±25% of spot index | Â±5% of spot index |
| After 10 minutes | Â±3% of recent premium average + 25% cap | Â±3% of recent premium average + 25% cap |

**Key Changes:**
- Immediate 5% price band for new contracts (previously 25%)
- Uniform application of price limits for both opening and closing positions
- Enhanced calculation methodology for premium values

### FAQ: How Do These Changes Affect Traders?

**Q:** How will the tighter price bands impact trading strategies?  
**A:** The reduced initial price limits (from 25% to 5%) provide greater protection against artificial price manipulation during contract launches. While this may temporarily limit arbitrage opportunities, it creates a more stable trading environment for all participants.

## User Data Adjustments and Fund Reconciliation

The rollback process required extensive user data verification and fund reconciliation. Special attention was given to transfers between spot and futures accounts during the affected period.

### Adjustment Scenarios

1. **Spot to Futures Transfers (March 30, 04:47-06:42):**  
   Users who transferred assets from spot to futures accounts during this window received retroactive credit adjustments, as the initial transactions failed to process correctly.

2. **Futures to Spot Transfers (March 30, 04:47-12:11):**  
   Inbound transfers to spot accounts required corresponding deductions from futures balances to maintain accounting accuracy.

### Balance Discrepancy Resolution

For users with insufficient futures account balances to cover required adjustments:
1. Deductions from spot account balances
2. Subsequent deductions from peer-to-peer and index accounts
3. Final resolution through withdrawal transaction reversals if necessary

## Contract Settlement and Reopening Schedule

The exchange followed a structured timeline for contract settlements and system restarts:

1. **Initial Rollback Completion:** 5:00 PM HKT on March 30
2. **Price Data Verification:** 8:00 PM HKT on March 30
3. **User Fund Adjustments:** 9:10 PM HKT on March 30
4. **Trading Resumption:** 1:12 AM HKT on March 31

### FAQ: What Happened to Pending Orders?

**Q:** Were open positions and orders affected by the rollback?  
**A:** Yes, all pending orders were canceled during the rollback process. Positions were recalculated based on the new price limits, and traders needed to re-enter positions after system restoration.

## Enhanced Security Measures and Compensation

In response to the incident, OKX implemented several preventive measures and offered user compensation:

1. **Fee Waiver Program:**  
   Complete exemption of futures trading fees from April 1-7, 2018

2. **Risk Control Upgrades:**
