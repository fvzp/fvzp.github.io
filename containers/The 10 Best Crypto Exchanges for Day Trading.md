## Frequently Asked Questions

### What defines successful day trading in crypto?
Successful crypto day trading requires rapid execution, access to liquid markets, and real-time analytics. Traders profit from short-term volatility rather than long-term asset value.

High liquidity ensures orders execute instantly at desired prices. Exchanges with CoinMarketCap scores above 600 typically provide adequate depth for scalping strategies.

With trading fees ranging from 0.005â€“0.1%, high-volume traders save significantly on platforms like MexC and Bybit. Fee discounts for using native tokens (e.g., BNB) further reduce costs.
