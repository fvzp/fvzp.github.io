## Strategic Implications of the Integration  

### Expanding Market Presence in South Korea  
Coinone's established reputation as a **CODE-compliant exchange** with millions of local users provides Deepcoin with immediate access to South Korea's sophisticated crypto ecosystem.

This symbiotic relationship addresses a critical pain point in crypto tradingâ€”regional liquidity fragmentationâ€”while maintaining strict adherence to South Korea's **Travel Rule** compliance requirements.  

### Strengthening Global Connectivity  
Deepcoin's integration strategy extends beyond technical collaboration. The exchange has demonstrated a multi-pronged approach to Korean market engagement, including:  
1. **CODE compliance certification** (January 2024)
