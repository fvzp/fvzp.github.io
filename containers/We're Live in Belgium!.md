## Navigating Cryptocurrency Risks in Belgium  
**Virtual currencies, real risks. The only guarantee in crypto is risk.**  

Before exploring OKX's expansion into Belgium, it's crucial to understand the inherent risks of cryptocurrency investments:  
- **Market volatility**: Prices can fluctuate dramatically, leading to potential total loss of investment.  
- **Lack of deposit insurance**: Unlike traditional bank deposits, crypto assets aren't protected by guarantee funds.  
- **Regulatory uncertainty**: Absence of legal frameworks to prevent market manipulation or insider trading.  
- **Technical dependencies**: Blockchain infrastructure, while innovative, remains vulnerable to technological failures.  
- **Access risks**: Losing private keys results in irreversible loss of stored assets.  
- **Adoption limitations**: Virtual currencies face limited acceptance as legal tender globally.  

These risks underscore the importance of informed decision-making when engaging with digital asset investment platforms.
